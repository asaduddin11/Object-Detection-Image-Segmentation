# Object-Detection-Image-Segmentation
The code in this repository is aimed at using an Intel Sense D435i depth sensing camera's live feed using OpenCV and applying Tensorflow's Mask RCnn Algorithm for Object detection using the COCO data set and Image segmentation and finally calculating the distance between the camera and the object detected.
